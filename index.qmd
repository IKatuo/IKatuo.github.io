Hi, I’m **Yuqi Sun** 👋  
I received my B.S. in **Medical Laboratory Science** from  
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/yxjsxy/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **human genetics and genomics, neuroscience, and oncology**, with a focus on understanding disease mechanisms through **computational and multi-omics approaches**.

Currently, I work with  
- [**Dr. Dongyuan Song**](https://dsong-lab.github.io/) at the **University of Connecticut Health Center**, where I develop **cross-modality models for spatial omics data**, and  
- [**Dr. Jie Zheng**](https://daoshi.shsmu.edu.cn/Pages/TeacherInformationView.aspx?uid=408f4cb5-9ad1-4222-b43a-f93df05ac45d&from=s&pId=100201&tId=) at the **Shanghai Institute of Metabolic and Endocrine Disease**, investigating the **genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of glucose homeostasis**.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate thesis under the supervision of  
[**Dr. Yuanquan Song**](https://www.med.upenn.edu/song-lab/) at the **Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia**, where I studied the **cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) proliferation**.

From April 2022 to October 2024, I served as a student project leader in the **Students’ Innovation Training Program**, conducting research in **genetic epidemiology**, particularly **Mendelian Randomization** and **multi-omics integration**, to identify novel drug targets for complex human diseases.  
This work led to publications on  
- [**ABO (BGAT) and gestational outcomes**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11126538/), and  
- [**the anti-aging potential of glucose-lowering drugs and their epigenetic mechanisms**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.25337858v1).

🎨 Outside of research, I enjoy **comics, sketching, and traditional Chinese painting**.  
🎵 I am also an amateur composer, with interests in **electronic and classical music**.
