I'm a [Quarto Academeic Website Template](https://github.com/drganghe/quarto-academic-website-template) adapted by [Dr. Gang He](http://drganghe.github.io).

I'm a template that you can fork to build your own website with easy adaptation and deployment.

1. **Star** this repository to bookmark it for future reference.  
1. **Fork** this repository and rename it to `YourGitHubUserName.github.io`.  
1. **Update** the `_quarto.yml` file to configure your site’s basic settings.  
1. **Add or edit content** in the following files and folders:
   - `/posts/` – posts about publications, news, events  
   - `teaching.qmd` – teaching information  
   - `projects.yml` – research or other projects  
   - `people.qmd` and `/people/` – team or collaborators  
   - `/files/` - profiles, images, pdfs, and includes 
1. [**Render and preview**](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) your site locally.  
1. [**Publish**](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) your site using GitHub Pages (make sure [configuring](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/images/gh-pages-docs-dir.png) your GitHub repository to publish from the `docs` directory, not the `root` folder).
