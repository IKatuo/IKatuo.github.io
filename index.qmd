Hi, I'm Yuqi 👋 . I received my B.S. in Medical Laboratory Science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University，School of Medicine](https://www.shsmu.edu.cn/yxjsxy/).

I'm interested in Human Genetics & Genomics, Neuroscience and Oncology. Currently, I am working with [**Dr. Dongyuan Song**](https://dsong-lab.github.io/) at University of Connecticut Health Center to develop cross-modality models for spatial omics data, and with [**Dr.Jie Zheng**](https://daoshi.shsmu.edu.cn/Pages/TeacherInformationView.aspx?uid=408f4cb5-9ad1-4222-b43a-f93df05ac45d&from=s&pId=100201&tId=) at Shanghai Institute of Metabolic and Endocrine Disease to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanism of glucose homeostasis. Previously, I did my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of [**Dr. Yuanquan Song**](https://www.med.upenn.edu/song-lab/) at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and investigated the cellular and molecular mechanism of pLGG proliferation. 

I served as a student project leader in the Students' Innovation Training Program from April 2022 to October 2024 and conducted research on genetic epigemiology, particularly Mendelian Randomization and multi-omics integretation, to identfy novel drug targets for complex human disease. Check out our first pub about [**ABO (BGAT) in gestational outcomes**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11126538/) and our second pub about [**the anti-aging potential of glucose-lowering drugs and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms**](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.13.25337858v1).

🎨 Outside of research, I enjoy creating Comics, Sketching and Chinese Painting!
🎵 I am also an amateur composer, engaged in electronic and classical music.
